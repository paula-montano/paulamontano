## Overview

The Party Manifesto for Irish Local and European Parliament Elections is a project in collaboration with Dr. Stefan MÃ¼ller and Arthur Baranov. It provides an overview of manifestos in Ireland from 1999 to 2024. The dashboard allows users to explore the content of manifestos, compare visions on specific issues across parties and identify changes over time. Users can also identify specific terms of interest (i.e. housing, immigration, economy, etc.) and see the frequency of these terms in the manifestos. 

This collection of manifestos is open-access and was built based on the collection of [Michael Pidgeon](http://www.michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/).
